# Accessibility

On the right, you will find the simple-looking pin input card. It is very easy to make; you just have to shift the focus, right? Hell no, believe me, this is not easy, especially when you think about accessibility. And at the end, you will see why.
<br /><br />
Now, why bother about accessibility for a pin input that's on our screen for less than 30 seconds, maybe more for some (ðŸ˜‰), but seriously, why should we care?
<br /><br />
In simple terms, accessibility enables people with disabilities to use the web easily. By designing and developing for them, we can really improve the overall user experience for everyone. Most think accessibility comes at an expense, but it's an investment that pays off in smiles, nods of approval, and forces you to make better products for everyone.
<br /><br />
I found myself in need of a pin input for an application, and while there are plenty of libraries out there, their solutions lacked accessibility and focus management. Even the ones that promote accessibility, like radix-ui, ariakit, react-aria, and more, surprisingly lacked a pin input component. So, I decided to take on the challenge and created my own pin-input which is accessible, unstyled and primitive apis like radix. Now, let's explore what I've built.
<br /><br />

1. The initial input is automatically focused; if not, a quick page refresh should do the trick. Now, type '123' â€“ notice how the focus gracefully shifts with each input. Click anywhere to lose focus, press 'tab,' and voila! The focus smartly returns to where you left off, precisely at the fourth place. Pretty cool, right? - Most component lacks this features.

2. Moving on to the code completion phase with '123456.' Upon completion, the system takes charge, auto-submits, and gracefully disables further interactions. But, whoops! An error alert surfaces, clearing all fields and tactfully redirecting focus back to the initial pin input.
3. When navigating by keyboard, you can't navigate when current input is empty.
4. Now, hit the copy button, and You will find The focus elegantly glides back to the first spot or its previous spot, if a few inputs are already filled.
   <br /><br />
   This phenomenon is known as 'Roving tabindex', a technique accomplished by tracking the tabindex of inputs and recalling the last indexed item. By handling the heavy lifting at the component level and exposing the necessary APIs, you can achieve this functionality with minimal intervention at the app level.
   <br /><br />
   All these little things are not necessary for the simple pin input, but only if you are building for yourself. Because this makes a huge difference in real-world applications.
   <br /><br />
   This kind of UX happens when you make accessibility a priority. Once you immerse yourself in the accessibility-first mindset, there's no going back. Keep in mind, Accessibility isn't just for those who require it but for everyone's enhanced experience.
   <br /><br />
   It's not just about a pin input; it's about crafting digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.

TL;DR:
Crafted a pin input for my app as existing libraries lacked accessibility. The pin input features automatic focus when pressing tab, code completion with auto-submit, resetting input on error while focusing the first input, and even retains focus when you're halfway through the pin, click outside to lose focus, press tab, and seamlessly resumes where it left off.
